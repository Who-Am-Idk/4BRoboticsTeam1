Building: Clutch design using two rubber wheels, or other two objects as plates, not needed. Robot functions and switches gears without a clutch. 
Programming: Eyeballed for switching gears, but it functions well enough. Unfortunately, the transmission must start in first gear, will attempt to fix this later.

Building: Need to work on the gearing system to mount the 2 motors for propelling the machine. Wanting to improve the drive shaft by cutting it down or replacing it with a new stable one. Also possibly add a differential for better steering? Will likely use a 1:1 gear ratio coming off the output axle to power the rear wheels. 

### 9/12/2023
Building: Mounted the two motors to the transmission, will mount the transmission asap.

### 9/19/2023 
Building: Decided not to build/design a differential so it's going to be a solid axle. Need to add a tensioner to the chain that is actively driving the axle. This is all going to be determined based on the time we take to program, and how long it takes us to build the tensioner and to stabilize both the transmission and drive axles.
Programming: The drive motor can now be controlled by pushing a joy stick forwards or backwards to go the intended direction - This allows for the speed of the robot to be controlled --Not that it needs to be since we just want max speed :)-- ...Whoops, need to reverse the motor rotation so that pushing the stick forward drives the wheel forward. 

### 9/21/2023
Decided a tensioner was unnecessary after stabilizing the axles. I also added the second wheel and finished the solid axle. We did a speed test in the halls 2 days ago and it worked until the battery ran too low and the single motor could no longer overcome the torque of the second gear. Now I have charged the battery fully and added a second motor. This won't increase speed or velocity but it will affect first-gear torque and second-gear acceleration. Today we will do a second speed test to attempt to find its top speed, which means we might need to borrow a radar gun from one of the physics teachers. In terms of tooling or object manipulation, as a new assignment asks, we will be trying to have a plow of sorts. I also made a dumb move yesterday in my attempt to get out of the school faster, I forgot to save the new program file, luckily for me and my programmer it was like 2 lines and a toggle switch in the program to reverse the motor direction. Basically, our goal today is just to make programming fixes, and I am going to make sure the axle is stable.

9/26/2023 7:45 AM, Today I will be stabilizing the other front wheel so steering becomes easier, and I will be working on building the plow as part of the assignment for an object manipulator.

9/28/23 12:50 PM, Okay, I procrastinated a little bit, I will work on the plow today

10/19/2023 12:45 PM, We gave up on the differential for now, also one of the other builders is starting to work on building a 4-speed transmission rather than our current "basic" 2-speed.

10/24/2023 11:30 AM, Once the other builder finishes, and proves the functionality of the 4-speed, we will rework motor positions, shifter systems, and basically the entire drive train. When he proves its effectiveness I will work on retrofitting the rear axle and actually add the differential in a better way. I will also be forced to reposition the rear right tire (looking at it from the back) at the moment it is actively bending that axle because of some stupid vex designed misalignment. Same parts on both sides right now, and it's still not lined up properly. So I'll fix that and then I can very easily put in the differential, with an axle coming off the transmission to a set of bevel gears which will power the gear used to run the differential.. this one is going to way infinitely more than the current 2 speed based on the sheer amount of metal and plastic being used.

10/24/2023 2:03 PM, Prototype differential system and shifter sprockets are built but the 4-speed is still giving problem after problem. ETA: maybe sometime next week
